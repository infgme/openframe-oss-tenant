<!-- source-hash: da7c81a7bfcca8856b8eb57877ede2e5 -->
A service for installing and managing tools in the OpenFrame agent system. Handles tool downloads from GitHub releases and API endpoints, manages executable permissions, and coordinates with other services for tool lifecycle management.

## Key Components

**ToolInstallationService**
- `new()` - Creates new installation service with all required dependencies
- `install()` - Main installation method that handles complete tool setup process

**Core Installation Features**
- Downloads tools from GitHub releases or Artifactory
- Manages tool assets and executable permissions
- Handles reinstallation with cleanup of existing installations
- Resolves command and URL parameters dynamically
- Creates tool-specific directories and manages file structure

**Integration Points**
- Coordinates with `ToolRunManager` and `ToolConnectionService`
- Uses `GithubDownloadService` for release downloads
- Integrates with `InstalledToolsService` for tracking
- Publishes installation events via `InstalledAgentMessagePublisher`

## Usage Example

```rust
use crate::services::ToolInstallationService;
use crate::models::ToolInstallationMessage;

// Create installation service with dependencies
let installation_service = ToolInstallationService::new(
    github_service,
    file_client,
    api_client,
    command_resolver,
    url_resolver,
    tools_service,
    directory_manager,
    run_manager,
    connection_manager,
    config_service,
    publisher,
    connection_service,
);

// Install a tool
let install_message = ToolInstallationMessage {
    tool_agent_id: "my-tool".to_string(),
    version: "1.0.0".to_string(),
    reinstall: false,
    // ... other fields
};

installation_service.install(install_message).await?;
```

The service handles the complete installation workflow including directory setup, asset downloads, permission management, and integration with the broader tool management ecosystem in OpenFrame.
