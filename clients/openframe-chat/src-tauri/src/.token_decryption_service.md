A cryptographic service that provides secure token decryption using AES-256-GCM encryption algorithm with base64 encoding for the Flamingo platform's authentication system.

## Key Components

- **`TokenDecryptionService`** - Main service struct that holds the 32-byte encryption key
- **`new(secret: String)`** - Constructor that validates and initializes the service with a 32-byte secret key
- **`decrypt(encrypted_data: &str)`** - Decrypts base64-encoded tokens that were encrypted with AES-256-GCM

## Usage Example

```rust
use token_decryption_service::TokenDecryptionService;

// Initialize the service with a 32-byte secret
let secret = "your_32_byte_secret_key_here_123!"; // Must be exactly 32 bytes
let service = TokenDecryptionService::new(secret.to_string())?;

// Decrypt a token
let encrypted_token = "base64_encoded_encrypted_data_here";
match service.decrypt(encrypted_token) {
    Ok(plaintext) => println!("Decrypted token: {}", plaintext),
    Err(e) => eprintln!("Decryption failed: {}", e),
}
```

The service expects encrypted data to be base64-encoded with the first 12 bytes as the nonce and the remaining bytes as the AES-GCM ciphertext. All operations return `Result<T, String>` for comprehensive error handling, including validation of secret key length, base64 decoding, and decryption operations.
