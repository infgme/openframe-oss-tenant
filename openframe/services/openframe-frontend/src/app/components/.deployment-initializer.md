A React component that initializes deployment detection and configuration at the application root level, logging deployment information and setting document attributes for debugging and styling purposes.

## Key Components

- **DeploymentInitializer** - Main component export that handles deployment initialization
- **useDeployment** - Custom hook import for accessing deployment state
- **useEffect** - React hook for handling initialization side effects

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { DeploymentInitializer } from '@/components/deployment-initializer'

function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <DeploymentInitializer />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}

// The component automatically:
// 1. Detects deployment type (cloud/self-hosted/development)
// 2. Logs deployment info to console
// 3. Sets data-deployment and data-hostname attributes on <html>
// 4. Enables CSS targeting: html[data-deployment="cloud"] { ... }
```

This component is designed to be mounted once at the application root and renders nothing visually. It provides essential deployment context that can be used for conditional styling, feature flags, or debugging across the Flamingo platform.
