TypeScript interface definitions for policy management in the Flamingo MSP platform, providing type safety for security policies, compliance checks, and host monitoring operations.

## Key Components

- **Policy** - Core interface defining security/compliance policy structure with metadata, execution status, and host statistics
- **DialogsResponse** - API response wrapper containing paginated policy results with total count
- **PolicyFilters** - Filter criteria interface for querying policies by status and source

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Define a new security policy
const policy: Policy = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Critical Security Updates",
  query: "SELECT * FROM vulnerabilities WHERE severity = 'critical'",
  category: "Security",
  enabled: true,
  critical: true,
  description: "Monitor for critical security vulnerabilities",
  author_id: 123,
  author_name: "John Doe",
  author_email: "john@company.com",
  team_id: 5,
  resolution: "Apply security patches immediately",
  platform: "osquery",
  calendar_events_enabled: false,
  created_at: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  updated_at: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  passing_host_count: 45,
  failing_host_count: 3,
  host_count_updated_at: "2024-01-15T12:00:00Z"
};

// Filter policies by status and source
const filters: PolicyFilters = {
  status: ["enabled", "critical"],
  source: ["osquery", "custom"]
};

// Handle API response
const response: DialogsResponse = {
  dialogs: [policy],
  total: 1
};
```
