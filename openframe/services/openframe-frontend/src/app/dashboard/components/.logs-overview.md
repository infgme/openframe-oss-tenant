This component renders the logs overview section of the dashboard, displaying log statistics cards alongside a list of recent log entries with navigation capabilities.

## Key Components

- **LogsOverviewSection** - Main component that combines log statistics and recent logs display
- **ExtendedLogEntry** - Type extending LogEntry to include original log data for navigation
- **useLogsOverview** - Custom hook for fetching dashboard log statistics
- **useLogs** - Hook for fetching raw log data
- **navigateToLogDetails** - Utility function for log entry navigation

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { LogsOverviewSection } from './logs-overview'

function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div className="dashboard">
      <LogsOverviewSection />
    </div>
  )
}
```

The component features a responsive grid layout with log severity cards (Info, Warning, Critical) on the left showing counts and percentages, and a scrollable list of the 10 most recent logs on the right. Each log entry can be clicked to navigate to detailed view. The statistics cards link to the full logs page and display progress indicators with severity-appropriate colors.
