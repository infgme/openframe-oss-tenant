This file defines GraphQL query operations for managing organizations within the Flamingo MSP platform, including comprehensive organization data retrieval, minimal list queries, and detailed individual organization lookups.

## Key Components

- **GET_ORGANIZATIONS_QUERY** - Full organization listing with search, pagination, and complete organization details including contact info, revenue, and contract dates
- **GET_ORGANIZATIONS_MIN_QUERY** - Minimal organization data query returning only essential fields (id, name, image) for lightweight operations like dropdowns
- **GET_ORGANIZATION_BY_ID_QUERY** - Detailed single organization retrieval including all contact information, addresses, and metadata

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { GET_ORGANIZATIONS_QUERY, GET_ORGANIZATION_BY_ID_QUERY } from './organizations-queries'

// Fetch paginated organizations with search
const { data } = await client.query({
  query: GET_ORGANIZATIONS_QUERY,
  variables: {
    search: "Acme Corp",
    pagination: {
      first: 10,
      after: "cursor123"
    }
  }
})

// Get detailed organization by ID
const { data: orgData } = await client.query({
  query: GET_ORGANIZATION_BY_ID_QUERY,
  variables: {
    id: "org_12345"
  }
})
```

The queries support cursor-based pagination for efficient data loading and include comprehensive organization metadata for MSP client management workflows.
