<!-- source-hash: a0404ed0505d6231888aec3082f827de -->
A React hook that provides device management actions for archiving and deleting devices with loading states and toast notifications.

## Key Components

- **`useDeviceActions`** - Main hook that returns device action functions and loading states
- **`UseDeviceActionsOptions`** - Interface for optional configuration including success callbacks
- **`archiveDevice`** - Function to archive a device by updating its status to 'ARCHIVED'
- **`deleteDevice`** - Function to delete a device by updating its status to 'DELETED'
- **Loading states** - `isArchiving`, `isDeleting`, and combined `isProcessing` flags

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { useDeviceActions } from './hooks/use-device-actions'

function DeviceManagement() {
  const { archiveDevice, deleteDevice, isProcessing } = useDeviceActions({
    onSuccess: () => {
      // Refresh device list or navigate away
      router.refresh()
    }
  })

  const handleArchive = async () => {
    const success = await archiveDevice('device-123', 'Server-01')
    if (success) {
      console.log('Device archived successfully')
    }
  }

  const handleDelete = async () => {
    const success = await deleteDevice('device-123', 'Server-01')
    if (success) {
      console.log('Device deleted successfully')
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleArchive} disabled={isProcessing}>
        Archive Device
      </button>
      <button onClick={handleDelete} disabled={isProcessing}>
        Delete Device
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Both actions use PATCH requests to update device status rather than actual deletion, providing soft delete functionality with user-friendly toast notifications for success and error states.
