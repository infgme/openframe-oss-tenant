Utilities for generating cross-platform device installation and uninstallation commands for the OpenFrame client binary.

## Key Components

- **buildInstallCommand()** - Generates platform-specific installation commands with server configuration
- **buildUninstallCommand()** - Creates uninstallation commands for removing the client
- **normalizeDevicePlatform()** - Normalizes various OS identifiers to standard platform IDs
- **Binary URL builders** - Helper functions for constructing GitHub release download URLs
- **Constants** - Release URLs and binary asset names for macOS and Windows

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { buildInstallCommand, normalizeDevicePlatform } from './device-command-utils'

// Generate installation command
const installCmd = buildInstallCommand({
  platform: 'windows',
  serverUrl: 'https://api.openframe.ai',
  initialKey: 'key123',
  orgId: 'org456',
  releaseVersion: 'v1.0.0',
  additionalArgs: ['--debug']
})

// Normalize device platform
const platform = normalizeDevicePlatform('Win32') // Returns 'windows'

// Build uninstall command
const uninstallCmd = buildUninstallCommand({
  platform: 'darwin',
  releaseVersion: 'latest'
})
```

The utility handles platform-specific command generation, including PowerShell commands for Windows and bash commands for macOS/Linux, with automatic binary downloading and execution with appropriate permissions.
