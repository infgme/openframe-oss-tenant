A MeshCentral file upload manager that handles chunked file transfers with hash verification, progress tracking, and resume capabilities.

## Key Components

- **`UploadTask`** - Interface defining upload job state including progress, status, and metadata
- **`FileUploader`** - Main class managing file upload operations with chunked transfer protocol
- **Core Methods**:
  - `uploadFile()` - Initiates file upload with optional hash checking
  - `calculateFileHash()` - Generates SHA-384 hash for duplicate detection
  - `handleUploadAck()` - Processes server acknowledgments and manages chunk flow
  - `sendNextChunk()` - Streams file data in configurable chunk sizes
  - `cancelUpload()` / `getUpload()` - Upload lifecycle management

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Initialize uploader with message handler and progress callback
const uploader = new FileUploader(
  (data) => websocket.send(data),
  (progress) => console.log(`${progress.file}: ${progress.progress}%`)
);

// Upload a file with hash verification
const file = new File(['content'], 'document.txt');
const uploadId = await uploader.uploadFile(file, '/remote/path/document.txt');

// Handle server responses
uploader.handleUploadStart(uploadId, 0);
uploader.handleUploadAck(uploadId);
uploader.handleUploadDone(uploadId);

// Monitor upload status
const task = uploader.getUpload(uploadId);
console.log(task?.status, task?.bytesUploaded);
```

The uploader supports resume functionality, handles binary data escaping, and maintains upload queues with progress reporting for integration with MeshCentral's file management system.
