This service orchestrates the complete lifecycle of tool installation on the Flamingo MSP platform, including downloading binaries from multiple sources, managing dependencies, handling version control, and setting up runtime environments.

## Key Components

- **ToolInstallationService**: Main orchestrator that coordinates tool installation across GitHub, Artifactory, and Tool API sources
- **install()**: Primary installation method handling version checks, asset downloads, permission management, and cleanup
- **Multi-source download support**: GitHub releases, Artifactory repositories, and Tool API endpoints
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Unix/Windows permission handling and file system operations
- **Dependency injection**: Manages 12+ service dependencies for comprehensive tool lifecycle management

## Usage Example

```rust
use crate::services::ToolInstallationService;
use crate::models::ToolInstallationMessage;

// Initialize service with all required dependencies
let installation_service = ToolInstallationService::new(
    github_download_service,
    tool_agent_file_client,
    tool_api_client,
    // ... other dependencies
);

// Install a tool with version control and asset management
let tool_message = ToolInstallationMessage {
    tool_agent_id: "monitoring-agent".to_string(),
    version: "1.2.3".to_string(),
    reinstall: false,
    download_configurations: Some(github_configs),
    assets: Some(tool_assets),
    // ... other fields
};

installation_service.install(tool_message).await?;
```

The service handles complex installation scenarios including reinstallation workflows, asset dependency resolution, executable permission management, and graceful cleanup of existing installations while maintaining tool process lifecycle coordination.
