A test binary that validates root/admin privilege detection and elevated command execution capabilities across different operating systems.

## Key Components

- **Admin Detection**: Uses `PermissionUtils::is_admin()` to check if the process has elevated privileges
- **Capability Testing**: Tests all available system capabilities including service management, file system access, and log operations
- **Elevated Command Execution**: Demonstrates `PermissionUtils::run_as_admin()` for privilege escalation when needed
- **Cross-platform System Commands**: Executes platform-specific system commands based on the target OS

## Usage Example

```rust
// Compile and run the test binary
cargo build --bin test_root_execution
./target/debug/test_root_execution

// When run without admin privileges:
// - Shows capability checks (all false)
// - Attempts to elevate privileges for a simple echo command
// - May prompt for user credentials

// When run with admin privileges:
// - Shows capability checks (should be true)
// - Executes system-specific commands:
//   - macOS: system_profiler for software data
//   - Linux: lsb_release for distribution info
//   - Windows: systeminfo for system details
```

The test provides interactive feedback and waits for user input before exiting, making it useful for manual testing of the permission system across different privilege levels and operating systems.
