A utility class that provides pre-defined GraphQL query strings for retrieving organization data from the OpenFrame API. This class centralizes commonly used organization queries to maintain consistency and reduce code duplication across the application.

## Key Components

- **ORGANIZATION_NAMES** - Query to fetch organization names only
- **ORGANIZATION_IDS** - Query to retrieve organization IDs for basic operations  
- **FULL_ORGANIZATION** - Comprehensive query that retrieves complete organization details including contact information, addresses, revenue, and metadata

## Usage Example

```java
import com.openframe.api.graphql.OrganizationQueries;

// Execute a query to get organization names
String query = OrganizationQueries.ORGANIZATION_NAMES;
GraphQLResponse response = graphQLClient.execute(query);

// Get full organization details with variables
String fullOrgQuery = OrganizationQueries.FULL_ORGANIZATION;
Map<String, Object> variables = Map.of("id", "org-123");
GraphQLResponse orgDetails = graphQLClient.execute(fullOrgQuery, variables);

// Access organization data
Organization org = response.getData("organization", Organization.class);
System.out.println("Organization: " + org.getName());
System.out.println("Revenue: " + org.getMonthlyRevenue());
```

The queries support both simple data retrieval (names/IDs) and comprehensive organization management with full contact details, addresses, financial information, and audit fields for tracking creation, updates, and soft deletes.
