A utility class that generates test data for organization entities using the Datafaker library to create realistic mock organizations with contact information, addresses, and contract details.

## Key Components

- **createOrganizationRequest()** - Generates a standard organization request with "Tech Solutions Inc" as the base template
- **updateOrganizationRequest()** - Creates a modified version for testing update operations with slightly different values
- **contactInformation()** - Builds contact information with conditional mailing address logic
- **address()** - Generates realistic address data using Faker
- **contactPerson()** - Creates contact person details with CEO role

## Usage Example

```java
// Generate organization with same mailing and physical address
CreateOrganizationRequest orgRequest = OrganizationGenerator.createOrganizationRequest(true);

// Generate organization with different mailing address
CreateOrganizationRequest orgWithSeparateMailingAddr = 
    OrganizationGenerator.createOrganizationRequest(false);

// Generate data for update testing
CreateOrganizationRequest updateRequest = 
    OrganizationGenerator.updateOrganizationRequest(true);

// The generated request will include:
// - Company name, category, employee count
// - Website URL and monthly revenue
// - Contract dates (start: now, end: +1 year)
// - Realistic addresses and contact person details
```

This generator is particularly useful for integration tests, database seeding, and API testing where consistent yet realistic organization data is needed. The boolean parameter allows testing both scenarios where mailing addresses match or differ from physical addresses.
