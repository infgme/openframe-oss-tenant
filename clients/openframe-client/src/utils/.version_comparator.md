A utility for comparing semantic version strings with automatic normalization to handle incomplete version formats.

## Key Components

- **VersionComparator** - Main struct providing version comparison functionality
- **compare()** - Compares two version strings and returns ordering (Less, Equal, Greater)
- **normalize()** - Internal helper that normalizes incomplete versions (e.g., "1.2" → "1.2.0")

## Usage Example

```rust
use std::cmp::Ordering;

let comparator = VersionComparator;

// Compare complete versions
assert_eq!(comparator.compare("1.2.3", "1.2.4"), Ordering::Less);

// Compare with automatic normalization
assert_eq!(comparator.compare("1.2", "1.2.0"), Ordering::Equal);
assert_eq!(comparator.compare("2", "1.5.3"), Ordering::Greater);

// Useful for sorting version lists
let mut versions = vec!["1.10", "1.2", "1.9.1"];
versions.sort_by(|a, b| comparator.compare(a, b));
// Result: ["1.2", "1.9.1", "1.10"]
```

The comparator leverages the `semver` crate for robust semantic version parsing and comparison, automatically normalizing incomplete versions by padding with ".0" as needed. This is particularly useful for handling version strings from different sources that may not follow complete semantic versioning format.
