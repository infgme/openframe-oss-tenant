Provides Windows-specific binary cleanup functionality for OpenFrame using PowerShell scripts to safely remove binaries after process termination. This module ensures clean uninstallation by handling file locks, directory removal, and PATH cleanup.

## Key Components

- **`generate_binary_cleanup_script`** - Creates a comprehensive PowerShell script that waits for process exit, removes binaries with retry logic, cleans up empty directories, and removes PATH entries
- **`execute_binary_cleanup_script`** - Creates and executes the cleanup script in the background as a detached process with proper Windows-specific configuration

## Usage Example

```rust
use std::path::PathBuf;

// Generate cleanup script for current process
let install_path = PathBuf::from("C:\\Program Files\\OpenFrame\\openframe.exe");
let bin_dir = Some(&PathBuf::from("C:\\Program Files\\OpenFrame\\bin"));

// Create and execute the cleanup script
execute_binary_cleanup_script(&install_path, bin_dir)?;

// Script runs in background and will:
// 1. Wait for current process (PID) to exit (max 30 seconds)
// 2. Force delete the binary with retry logic and permission fixes
// 3. Remove empty bin and parent directories
// 4. Clean up system PATH entries
// 5. Broadcast environment changes to Windows
```

The cleanup script uses advanced Windows techniques including `takeown`, `icacls` for permission handling, exponential backoff for retries, and broadcasts environment changes via Win32 API to ensure complete cleanup even when files are locked or in use.
