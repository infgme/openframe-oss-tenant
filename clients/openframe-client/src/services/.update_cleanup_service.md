Provides automated cleanup functionality for removing old backup files and temporary logs generated during OpenFrame update operations.

## Key Components

- **`UpdateCleanupService`** - Main service struct that manages cleanup operations
- **`new()`** - Constructor that initializes the service with the current executable path
- **`cleanup_all()`** - Public method that orchestrates cleanup of both backups and logs
- **`cleanup_all_old_backups()`** - Removes old backup files matching the pattern `{exe_name}.backup.*`
- **`cleanup_all_old_logs()`** - Removes temporary log files matching the pattern `openframe-update-*.log`

## Usage Example

```rust
use update_cleanup_service::UpdateCleanupService;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Initialize the cleanup service
    let cleanup_service = UpdateCleanupService::new()?;
    
    // Perform cleanup of all old files
    cleanup_service.cleanup_all().await;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

The service automatically discovers the current executable location and cleans up backup files created during updates as well as temporary log files stored in the system temp directory. All operations are logged with appropriate info/warn messages, and the service gracefully handles file system errors without panicking.
