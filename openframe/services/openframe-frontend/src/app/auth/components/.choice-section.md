<!-- source-hash: 7fd6aa917b208461c2b01b2449aaaa3c -->
A React component that provides dual authentication options with form validation and domain availability checking for organization creation and user sign-in.

## Key Components

- **AuthChoiceSection**: Main component with create organization and sign-in forms
- **Form validation**: Email regex, organization name validation, and access code verification
- **Domain management**: Subdomain availability checking with suggestions for SaaS mode
- **Loading states**: Individual loading states for different async operations
- **Error handling**: Toast notifications and inline error messages
- **ForgotPasswordModal**: Modal component for password recovery

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { AuthChoiceSection } from './choice-section'

function AuthPage() {
  const handleCreateOrg = async (orgName: string, domain: string, accessCode: string, email: string) => {
    // Handle organization creation
    console.log('Creating organization:', { orgName, domain, email })
  }

  const handleSignIn = async (email: string) => {
    // Handle user sign-in
    console.log('Signing in:', email)
  }

  return (
    <AuthChoiceSection
      onCreateOrganization={handleCreateOrg}
      onSignIn={handleSignIn}
      isLoading={false}
    />
  )
}
```

The component supports both SaaS shared mode (with subdomain and access code validation) and local development mode, automatically adapting its interface based on the app mode configuration.
