This file defines comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for Fleet MDM (Mobile Device Management) API responses, providing complete type safety for host data management and software inventory.

## Key Components

- **FleetHost** - Main interface representing a managed device with hardware specs, network info, software inventory, and system status
- **FleetSoftware** - Software package details including vulnerabilities, installation paths, and signature information
- **FleetMDMInfo** - MDM enrollment status, profiles, and device management state
- **FleetVulnerability** - Security vulnerability data with CVE identifiers and details
- **FleetUser** - System user account information with permissions and shell details
- **FleetBattery** - Battery health metrics for mobile devices
- **FleetLabel** - Device categorization and grouping labels
- **FleetIssues** - Policy compliance and system health issue counts

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { FleetHost, FleetHostResponse } from './fleet.types'

// Process Fleet API response
function processFleetHost(response: FleetHostResponse): void {
  const host = response.host
  
  console.log(`Device: ${host.hostname} (${host.platform})`)
  console.log(`Status: ${host.status}`)
  console.log(`Memory: ${host.memory}MB`)
  
  // Check software vulnerabilities
  host.software?.forEach(software => {
    if (software.vulnerabilities && software.vulnerabilities.length > 0) {
      console.log(`⚠️ ${software.name} has ${software.vulnerabilities.length} vulnerabilities`)
    }
  })
  
  // Monitor battery health
  host.batteries.forEach(battery => {
    console.log(`Battery health: ${battery.health} (${battery.cycle_count} cycles)`)
  })
}
```
