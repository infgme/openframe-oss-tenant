A minimal Rust application entry point that launches the main application through the `app_lib` crate, configured to hide the console window on Windows in release builds.

## Key Components

- **`main()`** - Entry point function that delegates execution to `app_lib::run()`
- **Windows subsystem configuration** - Conditional compilation attribute that prevents console window display on Windows release builds

## Usage Example

This file serves as the executable entry point and doesn't require direct interaction. The application is launched by running:

```rust
// The main function simply calls into the library
fn main() {
    app_lib::run();
}
```

The `#![cfg_attr(not(debug_assertions), windows_subsystem = "windows")]` attribute ensures that:
- In debug builds: Console window remains visible for debugging output
- In release builds on Windows: No console window appears, creating a cleaner user experience for GUI applications

This pattern separates the executable entry point from the main application logic, which is implemented in the `app_lib` crate. This is a common Rust pattern that allows for better testing and code organization, as the library code can be tested independently of the executable.
