Dashboard loading skeleton component that provides a detailed loading state that matches the actual dashboard layout exactly, including onboarding steps, device overview, chats (in SaaS tenant mode), and organizations sections.

## Key Components

- **`DashboardLoading`** - Main loading component that renders skeleton structure for entire dashboard
- **`InfoCardSkeleton`** - Reusable skeleton for dashboard info cards with progress indicators
- **`OnboardingStepCardSkeleton`** - Skeleton for individual onboarding step cards with responsive layout
- **`OnboardingSkeleton`** - Complete onboarding walkthrough skeleton with header and 5 vertical step cards
- **`DevicesSkeleton`** - Devices overview section with title, subtitle, and 2 info cards
- **`ChatsSkeleton`** - Chats overview section with title, subtitle, and 4 info cards (SaaS only)
- **`OrganizationsSkeleton`** - Organizations section with rows of organization cards and info cards
- **`OrganizationCardSkeleton`** - Individual organization card skeleton

## Usage Example

This component is used as a Next.js route-level loading UI for the dashboard page:

```typescript
// In your page.tsx or layout.tsx
import DashboardLoading from './loading'

// Next.js automatically uses this as loading UI
export default function Loading() {
  return <DashboardLoading />
}

// The skeleton adapts to app mode
const showChats = isSaasTenantMode() // Conditionally shows chat section
```

The component uses the `@flamingo-stack/openframe-frontend-core` Skeleton component and follows the exact layout structure of the actual dashboard components, ensuring a seamless loading experience that matches pixel-perfect dimensions and responsive breakpoints.
