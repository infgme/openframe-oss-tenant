Spring Boot configuration server application entry point that bootstraps the OpenFrame configuration management service.

## Key Components

- **ConfigServerApplication** - Main application class annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`
- **@Slf4j** - Lombok annotation providing SLF4J logging capabilities
- **main()** - Standard Spring Boot application entry point

## Usage Example

```java
// Run the configuration server
java -jar config-server.jar

// The application will start and listen for configuration requests
// from other OpenFrame microservices
```

This is a minimal Spring Boot application that serves as the configuration server for the OpenFrame platform. It uses Spring Boot's auto-configuration to set up the necessary beans and services. The `@Slf4j` annotation from Lombok provides logging functionality throughout the application. When started, this server will handle configuration management for distributed OpenFrame services, centralizing configuration data and enabling dynamic configuration updates across the platform.
