Handles agent registration with automatic retry logic for MSP agent enrollment in the Flamingo platform. Manages the registration lifecycle from initial machine identification through successful enrollment with configurable retry intervals.

## Key Components

- **RegistrationProcessor** - Main struct that orchestrates agent registration workflow
- **process()** - Primary entry point that checks for existing registration and initiates registration loop if needed
- **attempt_registration()** - Performs single registration attempt via the registration service
- **Dependencies** - Uses AgentRegistrationService for API calls and AgentConfigurationService for machine ID management

## Usage Example

```rust
use crate::services::{AgentRegistrationService, AgentConfigurationService};
use crate::registration_processor::RegistrationProcessor;

// Initialize services
let registration_service = AgentRegistrationService::new(api_client);
let config_service = AgentConfigurationService::new();

// Create processor and start registration
let processor = RegistrationProcessor::new(registration_service, config_service);
processor.process().await?;
```

The processor automatically:
- Checks for existing machine_id to avoid duplicate registrations  
- Implements retry loop with 60-second intervals on failure
- Logs registration progress and errors for debugging
- Returns successfully once registration completes or if already registered

Note: Currently uses fixed 60-second retry interval with TODO for exponential backoff implementation.
