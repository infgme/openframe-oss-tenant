Configuration module that generates navigation sidebar items for the OpenFrame platform based on the current app mode and pathname.

## Key Components

- **`getNavigationItems(pathname: string)`** - Main function that returns an array of navigation items filtered by app mode
- **Base Navigation Items** - Core navigation structure including Dashboard, Organizations, Devices, Scripts, and Logs
- **Mode-Specific Items** - Additional items (Tickets, Mingo) added only in SaaS tenant mode
- **Settings Item** - Always included in secondary section

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { getNavigationItems } from './navigation-config'

// Get navigation items for current page
const NavigationComponent = () => {
  const pathname = usePathname()
  const navigationItems = getNavigationItems(pathname)
  
  return (
    <nav>
      {navigationItems.map(item => (
        <NavItem
          key={item.id}
          label={item.label}
          icon={item.icon}
          path={item.path}
          isActive={item.isActive}
          section={item.section}
        />
      ))}
    </nav>
  )
}
```

The configuration automatically filters items based on app modes - returns empty array in auth-only mode, includes SaaS-specific features (Tickets and Mingo) in tenant mode, and always includes Settings in the secondary section. Each item includes proper active state detection based on the current pathname.
