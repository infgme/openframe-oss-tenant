A simple metrics initialization module that sets up metrics collection for the application with logging support.

## Key Components

- **`init()`** - Public function that initializes the metrics collection system and returns a Result for error handling

## Usage Example

```rust
use anyhow::Result;

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Initialize metrics collection during application startup
    metrics::init()?;
    
    // Continue with application logic
    println!("Application started with metrics enabled");
    
    Ok(())
}
```

The function currently serves as a placeholder that logs the initialization event and returns successfully. This provides a foundation for future metrics collection features while maintaining a clean API for application startup sequences.
