A Next.js client-side home page component that handles authentication-based routing and displays a loading skeleton while determining the appropriate redirect path.

## Key Components

- **Home Component**: Default export that manages initial page routing based on authentication state
- **Authentication Integration**: Uses `useAuthStore` to access current authentication status
- **Dynamic Routing**: Configured with `force-dynamic` to ensure server-side processing on each request
- **Loading State**: Shows `AppShellSkeleton` while authentication check and redirect occur

## Usage Example

```typescript
// This component automatically redirects users based on authentication:
// - Authenticated users: Redirected to dashboard or main app
// - Unauthenticated users: Redirected to login page

// The component uses the app-mode utility to determine redirect paths:
import { getDefaultRedirectPath } from '../lib/app-mode'

// Authentication state is managed globally:
import { useAuthStore } from './auth/stores/auth-store'

// Typical flow:
// 1. User visits root path "/"
// 2. Component checks authentication status
// 3. Redirects to appropriate path via getDefaultRedirectPath()
// 4. Shows skeleton loader during redirect process
```

The component serves as a smart routing entry point that eliminates the need for manual navigation logic by automatically directing users to their intended destination based on authentication state.
