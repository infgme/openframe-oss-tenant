A REST API client utility class for managing organizations in the OpenFrame platform using RestAssured for HTTP requests and GraphQL queries.

## Key Components

### Static Methods
- **`getOrganizationNames()`** - Retrieves list of organization names via GraphQL query
- **`getOrganizationIds()`** - Fetches all organization IDs using GraphQL
- **`retrieveOrganization(String id)`** - Gets complete organization details by ID
- **`createOrganization(CreateOrganizationRequest request)`** - Creates new organization via REST endpoint
- **`updateOrganization(String id, CreateOrganizationRequest request)`** - Updates existing organization
- **`deleteOrganization(Organization organization)`** - Removes organization by ID

### Dependencies
- Uses `RequestSpecHelper` for authorization
- Leverages GraphQL queries from `OrganizationQueries` class
- Supports both REST and GraphQL endpoints for different operations

## Usage Example

```java
// Get all organization names
List<String> orgNames = OrganizationApi.getOrganizationNames();

// Create new organization
CreateOrganizationRequest request = new CreateOrganizationRequest();
request.setName("My Company");
Organization newOrg = OrganizationApi.createOrganization(request);

// Retrieve full organization details
Organization org = OrganizationApi.retrieveOrganization(newOrg.getId());

// Update organization
request.setName("Updated Company Name");
Organization updatedOrg = OrganizationApi.updateOrganization(org.getId(), request);

// Delete organization
OrganizationApi.deleteOrganization(updatedOrg);
```

The class provides a comprehensive interface for organization CRUD operations, mixing GraphQL for read operations and REST for write operations, all with built-in authorization and response validation.
