React component that renders an architecture overview tab displaying integrated tools organized by layer with search functionality and credential management.

## Key Components

- **ArchitectureTab** - Main component that fetches, filters, and displays integrated tools
- **useIntegratedTools** - Custom hook for managing tool data and API calls
- **ServiceCard** - UI component for displaying individual tool information with actions
- **SearchBar** - Search input component for filtering tools
- **Skeleton** - Loading placeholder component

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { ArchitectureTab } from './architecture'

// Use within a tab container or page
function ArchitecturePage() {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <ArchitectureTab />
    </div>
  )
}

// The component automatically:
// - Fetches enabled integrated tools on mount
// - Provides real-time search filtering
// - Groups tools by layer (alphabetically sorted)
// - Displays tool URLs, credentials, and actions
// - Shows loading skeletons during data fetch
```

The component features search across tool names, descriptions, categories, layers, and URLs. Tools are grouped by their layer property and displayed as service cards with copyable credentials, clickable URLs, and reveal actions for sensitive data. Loading states show skeleton placeholders in a responsive grid layout.
