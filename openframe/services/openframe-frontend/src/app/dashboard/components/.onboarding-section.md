A React component that provides an onboarding walkthrough interface for the OpenFrame dashboard, guiding users through essential setup steps like organization configuration, device management, team setup, SSO configuration, and knowledge base access.

## Key Components

- **OnboardingSection** - Main component that renders the onboarding walkthrough
- **onboardingSteps** - Configuration array defining five setup steps with icons, descriptions, and actions
- **useOnboardingCompletion** - Custom hook for tracking completion status and loading states
- **OnboardingWalkthrough** - Core walkthrough component from `@flamingo-stack/openframe-frontend-core`

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { OnboardingSection } from './onboarding-section'

export function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div className="dashboard">
      <h1>Welcome to OpenFrame</h1>
      <OnboardingSection />
      {/* Other dashboard content */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

The component automatically handles navigation to different setup pages (`/organizations/edit/new`, `/devices/new`, `/settings`) and external links (knowledge base). Each step includes visual icons, completion tracking, and appropriate routing actions. The walkthrough state is persisted using the storage key `"openframe-dashboard-onboarding"`.
