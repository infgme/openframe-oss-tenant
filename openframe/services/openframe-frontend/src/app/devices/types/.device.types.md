Provides comprehensive TypeScript type definitions for device management across multiple platforms. This serves as the unified schema for handling devices from Fleet MDM, Tactical RMM, and MeshCentral in the OpenFrame MSP platform.

## Key Components

- **`Device`** - Main unified device interface with flattened structure containing hardware, software, network, and status information
- **`Software`** - Represents installed applications with vulnerability tracking across multiple package sources
- **`ToolConnection`** - Manages connections between devices and different RMM/MDM tools
- **`DeviceFilters`** - Provides filtering capabilities for device lists with status, type, and organization filters
- **`Vulnerability`** - Security vulnerability information linked to software installations
- **`MDMInfo`** - Mobile Device Management enrollment and status data
- **`DeviceTag`** - Organizational tagging system for device categorization

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { Device, Software, ToolConnection } from './device.types'

// Create a device with unified structure
const device: Device = {
  id: "dev-123",
  machineId: "machine-456",
  hostname: "workstation-01",
  displayName: "John's MacBook Pro",
  status: "online",
  platform: "darwin",
  os_version: "14.0",
  memory: 17179869184, // 16GB in bytes
  cpu_brand: "Apple M2 Pro",
  cpu_physical_cores: 10,
  primary_ip: "192.168.1.100",
  organizationId: "org-789"
}

// Add software with vulnerabilities
const software: Software = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Google Chrome",
  version: "118.0.5993.117",
  source: "apps",
  vulnerabilities: [{
    cve: "CVE-2023-5997",
    details_link: "https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-5997",
    created_at: "2023-11-15T10:00:00Z"
  }],
  installed_paths: ["/Applications/Google Chrome.app"]
}

// Connect to management tool
const toolConnection: ToolConnection = {
  id: "conn-123",
  machineId: "machine-456",
  toolType: "FLEET_MDM",
  agentToolId: "fleet-agent-789",
  status: "connected",
  connectedAt: "2023-11-01T09:00:00Z"
}
