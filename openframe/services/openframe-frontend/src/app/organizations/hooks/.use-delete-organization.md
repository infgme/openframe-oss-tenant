A React hook that provides functionality to delete organizations via API, with error handling and response validation.

## Key Components

- **useDeleteOrganization**: Main hook that returns a `deleteOrganization` function
- **deleteOrganization**: Memoized callback function that accepts an organization ID and performs the deletion
- **Error handling**: Throws descriptive errors for failed API requests

## Usage Example

```typescript
'use client'

import { useDeleteOrganization } from '@/hooks/use-delete-organization'
import { useState } from 'react'

function DeleteOrganizationButton({ organizationId }: { organizationId: string }) {
  const { deleteOrganization } = useDeleteOrganization()
  const [isDeleting, setIsDeleting] = useState(false)

  const handleDelete = async () => {
    if (!confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this organization?')) return
    
    try {
      setIsDeleting(true)
      await deleteOrganization(organizationId)
      // Handle success (e.g., redirect or refresh data)
      console.log('Organization deleted successfully')
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to delete organization:', error.message)
      // Handle error (e.g., show toast notification)
    } finally {
      setIsDeleting(false)
    }
  }

  return (
    <button 
      onClick={handleDelete} 
      disabled={isDeleting}
      className="bg-red-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded disabled:opacity-50"
    >
      {isDeleting ? 'Deleting...' : 'Delete Organization'}
    </button>
  )
}
```

The hook uses `useCallback` to memoize the delete function, preventing unnecessary re-renders. It makes a DELETE request to `/api/organizations/{id}` and throws an error if the response is not successful, allowing consuming components to handle errors appropriately.
