A React component that provides an interface for running scripts on selected devices in the Flamingo MSP platform. The component handles script execution across multiple devices with device filtering, selection management, and bulk action submission.

## Key Components

- **RunScriptView**: Main component that orchestrates script execution workflow
- **useRunScriptData**: Custom hook for fetching script details and device data
- **ScriptInfoSection**: Displays script information and metadata
- **SelectCard**: Device selection cards with type and OS information
- **Device Selection Logic**: Multi-device selection with search and filtering capabilities
- **Bulk Action Handler**: Submits scripts to multiple Tactical RMM agents simultaneously

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { RunScriptView } from './run-script-view'

// Use in a Next.js page or component
function ScriptExecutionPage({ params }: { params: { scriptId: string } }) {
  return (
    <RunScriptView scriptId={params.scriptId} />
  )
}

// The component handles:
// - Loading script details and available devices
// - Device search and filtering with debounced input
// - Multi-device selection with toggle functionality
// - OS-specific shell selection (PowerShell/CMD for Windows, bash for Unix)
// - Bulk script execution via Tactical RMM API
// - Toast notifications for success/error feedback
```

The component integrates with the Tactical RMM backend to execute scripts across managed devices, providing a comprehensive interface for MSP technicians to deploy automation at scale. It includes proper error handling, loading states, and user feedback mechanisms for reliable script deployment workflows.
