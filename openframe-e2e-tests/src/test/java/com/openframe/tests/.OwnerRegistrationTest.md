Test class that validates the complete owner user registration flow in OpenFrame, verifying user creation, authentication, and default organization setup.

## Key Components

- **testRegisterNewUser()** - Creates a new owner user through the registration API and validates response data
- **testLoginNewUser()** - Authenticates the newly registered user and verifies login success
- **testDefaultOrganizationCreated()** - Confirms that a default organization is automatically created for the owner
- **@Tag("start")** - Marks this as a startup test that runs before other test suites
- **@TestMethodOrder** - Ensures tests execute in sequential order (1, 2, 3)

## Usage Example

```java
// This test class runs automatically as part of the test suite
// Individual test methods can be run separately if needed

// To run just the registration test:
@Test
public void testRegisterNewUser() {
    UserRegistrationRequest request = newUserRegistrationRequest();
    UserRegistrationResponse response = registerUser(request);
    
    // Validates response contains required fields
    assertThat(response.getId()).isNotNull();
    assertThat(response.getOwnerId()).isNotNull();
    
    // Saves user data for subsequent tests
    saveUser(registeredOwner(request, response));
}

// Tests are designed to run in sequence:
// 1. Register owner user
// 2. Login with new credentials  
// 3. Verify default organization exists
```

The test extends `UnauthorizedTest` and uses static imports from various API and helper classes to streamline the testing workflow. It serves as a foundational test that prepares the system state for subsequent test execution.
