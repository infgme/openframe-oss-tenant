A modal component that displays a newly created API key with secure copy functionality and warnings about one-time visibility.

## Key Components

**ApiKeyCreatedModal** - Main modal component that manages API key display and clipboard operations
- `isOpen` - Controls modal visibility
- `fullKey` - The complete API key to display
- `onClose` - Callback function when modal is closed

**Key Features:**
- **Security Warning**: Prominent alert indicating one-time visibility
- **Clipboard Integration**: Copy functionality with toast notifications
- **State Management**: Local key state with cleanup on close
- **Responsive Design**: Max-width container with proper spacing

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { ApiKeyCreatedModal } from './api-key-created-modal'

function ApiKeyManagement() {
  const [showModal, setShowModal] = useState(false)
  const [apiKey, setApiKey] = useState<string | null>(null)

  const handleKeyCreated = (newKey: string) => {
    setApiKey(newKey)
    setShowModal(true)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={() => createApiKey().then(handleKeyCreated)}>
        Create API Key
      </Button>
      
      <ApiKeyCreatedModal
        isOpen={showModal}
        fullKey={apiKey}
        onClose={() => {
          setShowModal(false)
          setApiKey(null)
        }}
      />
    </>
  )
}
```

The component follows security best practices by clearing the key from local state when closed and providing clear warnings about the one-time nature of key visibility.
