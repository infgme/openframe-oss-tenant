Utility function that transforms GraphQL device data into a standardized Device object for list view rendering.

## Key Components

**`createDeviceListItem(node: DevicesGraphQLNode): Device`**
- Transforms GraphQL device node into normalized Device format
- Optimized for list views with minimal API overhead
- Sets undefined for properties not available in list context (CPU, memory, disk details)

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { createDeviceListItem } from './device-transform'
import { DevicesGraphQLNode } from '../types/device.types'

// Transform GraphQL response for device list
const graphqlNodes: DevicesGraphQLNode[] = await fetchDevicesFromGraphQL()

const deviceListItems = graphqlNodes.map(node => createDeviceListItem(node))

// Now you have standardized Device objects for list rendering
deviceListItems.forEach(device => {
  console.log(`Device: ${device.hostname} (${device.status})`)
  console.log(`Organization: ${device.organization}`)
  console.log(`IP: ${device.primary_ip}`)
})
```

The function handles mapping between different property names (e.g., `node.ip` → `device.primary_ip`), extracts tactical RMM connections, and ensures consistent data structure across the application while leaving heavy properties undefined for performance.
