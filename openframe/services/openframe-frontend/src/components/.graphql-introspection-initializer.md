A React component that initializes GraphQL schema introspection after user authentication to enable automatic URL state management for nested GraphQL input types.

## Key Components

- **GraphQLIntrospectionInitializer**: Main component that monitors authentication state and triggers introspection
- **useAuthStore**: Hook to access authentication state and user data
- **initializeGraphQLIntrospection**: External function that performs the actual schema introspection
- **hasInitialized**: Ref to prevent duplicate initialization during the session

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { GraphQLIntrospectionInitializer } from './graphql-introspection-initializer'

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        {/* Place near the root of your app */}
        <GraphQLIntrospectionInitializer />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

The component automatically:
- Waits for user authentication before initializing
- Caches schema data in localStorage for 24 hours
- Resets initialization state when users log out
- Handles initialization errors gracefully without breaking URL state hooks
- Runs introspection asynchronously to avoid blocking the UI

This initialization enables URL state management hooks to automatically flatten nested GraphQL input types, improving developer experience when working with complex GraphQL mutations and queries.
