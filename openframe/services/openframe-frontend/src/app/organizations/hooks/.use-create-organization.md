A React hook for creating organizations through the API with comprehensive organization data including contact information and addresses.

## Key Components

- **`CreateOrganizationRequest`** - Main interface defining organization creation payload with name, category, employee count, revenue, contract dates, and contact information
- **`ContactInformationDto`** - Interface for organization contact details including contact persons and addresses
- **`ContactPersonDto`** - Interface for individual contact person with name, title, phone, and email
- **`AddressDto`** - Interface for physical and mailing addresses with optional fields
- **`useCreateOrganization`** - Custom hook that returns a `createOrganization` function for making POST requests to the organizations API

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { useCreateOrganization } from './use-create-organization'

function CreateOrgForm() {
  const { createOrganization } = useCreateOrganization()

  const handleSubmit = async (formData: any) => {
    try {
