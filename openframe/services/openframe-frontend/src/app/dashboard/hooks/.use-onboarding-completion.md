React hook that tracks onboarding step completion status by aggregating data from multiple existing dashboard hooks, implementing race condition mitigations and optimized loading states.

## Key Components

- **useOnboardingCompletion**: Main hook that monitors completion of four onboarding steps
- **completionStatus**: Memoized object tracking completion state for each onboarding step
- **Race condition mitigations**: Uses refs to prevent duplicate API calls and stable callbacks
- **Loading state management**: Aggregates loading states from multiple data sources

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { useOnboardingCompletion } from './use-onboarding-completion'

function OnboardingDashboard() {
  const { completionStatus, isLoading } = useOnboardingCompletion()

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading onboarding status...</div>
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Onboarding Progress</h2>
      {Object.entries(completionStatus).map(([step, completed]) => (
        <div key={step}>
          {step}: {completed ? '✅ Complete' : '⏳ Pending'}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

The hook tracks four onboarding steps:
- **sso-configuration**: At least one SSO provider enabled
- **organizations-setup**: More than one organization created
- **device-management**: At least one device registered
- **company-and-team**: More than one user added
