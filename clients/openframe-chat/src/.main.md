Application entry point that bootstraps the React application by creating a root container and rendering the main App component in strict mode.

## Key Components

- **ReactDOM.createRoot()** - Creates a React 18 root container attached to the DOM element with id 'root'
- **React.StrictMode** - Wrapper component that enables additional development-time checks and warnings
- **App** - Main application component imported from './App'

## Usage Example

This file is typically not imported directly but serves as the application entry point referenced in build tools:

```typescript
// vite.config.ts or webpack configuration
export default {
  entry: './src/main.tsx',
  // ... other config
}
```

The file expects an HTML element with id 'root' to exist in the DOM:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<div id="root"></div>
```

## Development vs Production

In development, React.StrictMode enables:
- Double-invoking effects to detect side effects
- Deprecated API warnings
- Unsafe lifecycle method warnings

In production builds, StrictMode has no impact on performance as the checks are removed during compilation.
