A Data Transfer Object (DTO) that represents address information for organizations within the OpenFrame platform, providing a structured way to transfer address data between different layers of the application.

## Key Components

- **street1** - Primary street address line
- **street2** - Secondary street address line (optional)
- **city** - City name
- **state** - State or province
- **postalCode** - ZIP/postal code
- **country** - Country name

## Usage Example

```java
// Creating an address using builder pattern
AddressDto address = AddressDto.builder()
    .street1("123 Main Street")
    .street2("Suite 100")
    .city("San Francisco")
    .state("CA")
    .postalCode("94105")
    .country("USA")
    .build();

// Creating with constructor
AddressDto address2 = new AddressDto(
    "456 Oak Avenue", 
    null, 
    "New York", 
    "NY", 
    "10001", 
    "USA"
);

// Accessing fields (Lombok generates getters/setters)
String fullAddress = address.getStreet1() + ", " + 
                    address.getCity() + ", " + 
                    address.getState() + " " + 
                    address.getPostalCode();
```

The class uses Lombok annotations to automatically generate boilerplate code including constructors, getters, setters, equals, hashCode, and toString methods, making it ideal for transferring address data in REST APIs and service communications.
