A comprehensive React table component for displaying and managing organizations with advanced filtering, search, and cursor-based pagination capabilities. Built on the OpenFrame UI system with feature flag support for optional organization images.

## Key Components

- **OrganizationsTable** - Main table component with search, filters, and pagination
- **OrganizationNameCell** - Custom cell renderer for organization names with optional icons
- **UIOrganizationEntry** - TypeScript interface defining the table row data structure

## Features

- **Cursor-based pagination** with server-side data fetching
- **Multi-filter support** for tier and industry categories  
- **Real-time search** with debounced API calls
- **Batch image loading** for organization icons (feature-flagged)
- **Responsive design** with conditional column hiding
- **Row click navigation** to organization detail pages
- **Add organization** action button

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { OrganizationsTable } from './organizations-table'

function OrganizationsPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Table handles all state management internally */}
      <OrganizationsTable />
    </div>
  )
}

// The table automatically:
// - Fetches organizations from API
// - Manages URL params for filters and pagination
// - Handles search with cursor-based pagination
// - Provides add/view organization actions
```

The component integrates with URL parameters for deep-linkable filtering and search states, making it suitable for bookmarking and sharing filtered organization views.
