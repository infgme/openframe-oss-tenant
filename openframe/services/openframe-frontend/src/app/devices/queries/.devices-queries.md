Provides GraphQL query definitions for device management operations in the Flamingo platform, including device listing, filtering, and detailed device information retrieval.

## Key Components

- **GET_DEVICE_FILTERS_QUERY** - Retrieves available filter options and counts for device queries (statuses, types, OS, organizations, tags)
- **GET_DEVICES_QUERY** - Fetches paginated device list with comprehensive device information, organization details, and tool connections
- **GET_DEVICE_QUERY** - Retrieves detailed information for a single device by machine ID
- **GET_DEVICES_OVERVIEW_QUERY** - Lightweight query for device status overview with minimal data transfer

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { GET_DEVICES_QUERY, GET_DEVICE_QUERY } from './devices-queries'

// Query devices with filtering and pagination
const devicesVariables = {
  filter: { 
    statuses: ['ONLINE', 'OFFLINE'],
    organizationIds: ['org-123'] 
  },
  pagination: { first: 20, after: null },
  search: 'laptop'
}

// Query single device details
const deviceVariables = {
  machineId: 'machine-abc-123'
}

// Use with GraphQL client
const devicesResult = await client.query({
  query: GET_DEVICES_QUERY,
  variables: devicesVariables
})

const deviceResult = await client.query({
  query: GET_DEVICE_QUERY,
  variables: deviceVariables
})
```

The queries support cursor-based pagination, flexible filtering by multiple device attributes, and include comprehensive device metadata including organization relationships, tool connections, and installed agents.
