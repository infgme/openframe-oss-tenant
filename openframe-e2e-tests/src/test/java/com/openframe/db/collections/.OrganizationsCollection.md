MongoDB collection utility class for managing Organization entities in the OpenFrame platform, providing simplified query methods for finding organizations by various criteria.

## Key Components

- **`findOrganization(String id)`** - Retrieves a single organization by its ObjectId
- **`findOrganization(boolean deleted, boolean isDefault)`** - Finds an organization by deletion status and default flag
- **`findOrganizationIds(boolean deleted)`** - Returns a list of organization IDs filtered by deletion status

## Usage Example

```java
// Find organization by ID
Organization org = OrganizationsCollection.findOrganization("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011");

// Find the default active organization
Organization defaultOrg = OrganizationsCollection.findOrganization(false, true);

// Get all active organization IDs
List<String> activeOrgIds = OrganizationsCollection.findOrganizationIds(false);

// Get all deleted organization IDs
List<String> deletedOrgIds = OrganizationsCollection.findOrganizationIds(true);
```

The class uses MongoDB filters to query the "organizations" collection and leverages the generic `getCollection()` method from the MongoDB utility class. All methods are static for convenient access throughout the application without requiring instantiation.
