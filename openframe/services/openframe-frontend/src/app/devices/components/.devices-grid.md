A responsive grid component that displays device cards with filtering capabilities, loading states, and navigation to device details.

## Key Components

- **DevicesGrid** - Main component that renders devices in a responsive card grid layout
- **DeviceCard** - Individual device card component from the core UI library
- **ContentLoadingContainer** - Wrapper that handles loading states with skeleton UI
- **StatusTag** - Status badge component showing device status with appropriate styling
- **Filter display** - Shows active filters as removable tags above the grid

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { DevicesGrid } from './devices-grid'
import { Device } from '../types/device.types'

const MyDevicesPage = () => {
  const [devices, setDevices] = useState<Device[]>([])
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true)
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState({
    statuses: ['online', 'offline'],
    deviceTypes: ['laptop', 'desktop'],
    osTypes: ['Windows', 'macOS']
  })

  return (
    <DevicesGrid
      devices={devices}
      isLoading={isLoading}
      filters={filters}
    />
  )
}
```

The component automatically handles responsive layout (1-4 columns based on screen size), displays active filters as chips, shows skeleton loading states, and navigates to device details when cards are clicked. It gracefully handles empty states and maps device data to the standardized card format.
