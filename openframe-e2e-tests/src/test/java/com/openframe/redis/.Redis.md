A Redis utility class that provides methods for interacting with Redis cache storage, specifically for managing password reset tokens.

## Key Components

- **`getResetToken(String email)`** - Static method that searches Redis for a password reset token associated with a given email address
- **Redis connection management** - Creates and properly closes Redis client connections
- **Pattern matching** - Uses Redis SCAN command with pattern matching to find relevant keys

## Usage Example

```java
// Retrieve a password reset token for a user
String email = "user@example.com";
String resetToken = Redis.getResetToken(email);

if (resetToken != null) {
    // Token found, proceed with password reset flow
    System.out.println("Reset token found: " + resetToken);
} else {
    // No token found for this email
    System.out.println("No reset token found for email: " + email);
}
```

The class uses the Redis SCAN command to efficiently search through keys matching the pattern `pwdreset:*`, comparing stored email values until a match is found. It properly manages Redis connections by closing them after use and handles cursor-based iteration for large datasets.
