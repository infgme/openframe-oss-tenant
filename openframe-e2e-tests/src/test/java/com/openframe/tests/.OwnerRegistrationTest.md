Test suite for owner user registration flow in the OpenFrame MSP platform, covering the complete user onboarding process from registration through authentication and default organization setup.

## Key Components

- **testRegisterNewUser()** - Creates a new owner user account and validates response data integrity
- **testResetPassword()** - Tests password reset functionality using email-based token verification
- **testLoginNewUser()** - Authenticates the registered user and verifies session establishment
- **testDefaultOrganizationCreated()** - Confirms automatic creation of default organization for new owners

## Usage Example

```java
// This test class runs with @Tag("start") to execute before other test suites
// Tests are ordered using @Order annotations to ensure proper execution sequence

@Test
@Order(1)
@DisplayName("Register New Owner user")
public void testRegisterNewUser() {
    UserRegistrationRequest request = newUserRegistrationRequest();
    UserRegistrationResponse response = registerUser(request);
    
    // Validate response contains required fields
    assertThat(response.getId()).isNotNull();
    assertThat(response.getOwnerId()).isNotNull();
    
    // Save user for subsequent tests
    saveUser(registeredOwner(request, response));
}
```

The test extends `UnauthorizedTest` and uses ordered execution to simulate a complete owner registration workflow, ensuring each step completes successfully before proceeding to the next phase of user onboarding.
