A React component that displays a comprehensive dashboard overview of chat statistics and metrics for the Flamingo platform's AI-powered support system.

## Key Components

- **ChatsOverviewSection**: Main component that renders the chats overview dashboard section
- **useChatsOverview**: Custom hook for fetching chat statistics data
- **DashboardInfoCard**: Reusable card component from the core library for displaying metrics

## Key Features

- Responsive grid layout (1-4 columns based on screen size)
- Displays total chat count with localized number formatting
- Shows four key metrics: Active Chats, Resolved Chats, Average Resolve Time, and Average Fae Rating
- Progress indicators for active and resolved chat percentages
- All cards link to the `/mingo` route for detailed views

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { ChatsOverviewSection } from './chats-overview'

function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div className="dashboard">
      <ChatsOverviewSection />
      {/* Other dashboard sections */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

The component automatically fetches and displays chat metrics using the `useChatsOverview` hook, presenting them in an organized grid of interactive cards with progress indicators where applicable.
