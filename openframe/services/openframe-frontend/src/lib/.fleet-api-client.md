This TypeScript file provides a specialized API client for interacting with Fleet MDM (Mobile Device Management) services, extending the base API client with Fleet-specific endpoints and functionality.

## Key Components

- **FleetApiClient class** - Main client extending base API functionality with Fleet-specific methods
- **Type definitions** - `Query`, `Host` interfaces for Fleet data structures
- **HTTP methods** - Standard REST operations (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- **Fleet endpoints** - Specialized methods for policies, queries, hosts, teams, labels, and packs
- **URL construction** - Dynamic base URL building from tenant configuration
- **Exported instance** - Pre-configured `fleetApiClient` singleton

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { fleetApiClient } from './fleet-api-client'

// Get all Fleet policies with optional filtering
const policies = await fleetApiClient.getPolicies({
  team_id: 123,
  query: 'security'
})

// Create a new security policy
const newPolicy = await fleetApiClient.createPolicy({
  name: 'Security Compliance Check',
  query: 'SELECT * FROM processes WHERE name LIKE "%malware%"',
  description: 'Check for potential malware processes',
  critical: true,
  platform: 'linux'
})

// Run a live query on specific hosts
const queryResult = await fleetApiClient.runLiveQuery({
  query: 'SELECT name, version FROM programs',
  host_ids: [1, 2, 3]
})

// Get host details with policies
const hostDetails = await fleetApiClient.getHost(123)
const hostPolicies = await fleetApiClient.getHostPolicies(123)
```

The client automatically handles URL construction for multi-tenant environments and provides type-safe interfaces for all Fleet MDM operations including device management, policy enforcement, and query execution.
