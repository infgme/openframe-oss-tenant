A React component that displays network information for devices in a structured layout with IP address categorization and intelligent sorting.

## Key Components

- **NetworkTab**: Main component that renders network information cards with public IP, IPv4, and IPv6 addresses
- **IP Address Categorization**: Separates and sorts IPv4 and IPv6 addresses with Fleet MDM primary IP prioritization
- **Tooltip Integration**: Provides contextual help information for each network section
- **Responsive Layout**: Uses grid system for optimal display across different screen sizes

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { NetworkTab } from './network-tab'

// Device object with network data from Fleet MDM
const deviceData = {
  public_ip: '203.0.113.1',
  primary_ip: '192.168.1.100',
  local_ips: [
    '192.168.1.100',
    '10.0.0.50',
    '2001:db8::1',
    '192.168.1.15'
  ]
}

function DeviceDetails() {
  return (
    <div>
      <NetworkTab device={deviceData} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

The component automatically prioritizes Fleet MDM primary IP addresses, sorts IPv4 addresses numerically, and provides copyable IP values with helpful tooltips explaining each network type's purpose for IT support workflows.
