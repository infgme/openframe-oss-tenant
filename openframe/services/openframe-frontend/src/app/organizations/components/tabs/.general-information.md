<!-- source-hash: d734076a17b28de285c8eb213ff5a832 -->
A React component for editing general organization information including basic details, SLA settings, contract dates, and logo upload functionality.

## Key Components

- **`GeneralInfoState`** - TypeScript interface defining all organization data fields
- **`GeneralInformationTab`** - Main form component with responsive grid layout
- **Image Upload Integration** - Conditional logo uploader with authenticated upload/delete
- **Form Controls** - Input fields, selects, textarea, and date pickers for organization data

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { GeneralInformationTab, GeneralInfoState } from './general-information'

function OrganizationSettings() {
  const [orgData, setOrgData] = useState<GeneralInfoState>({
    name: '',
    category: '',
    employees: '',
    serviceTier: 'Basic',
    sla: 'Medium',
    mrr: '',
    website: '',
    contractStart: '',
    contractEnd: '',
    notes: '',
  })

  return (
    <GeneralInformationTab
      value={orgData}
      onChange={setOrgData}
      organizationId="org-123"
    />
  )
}
```

The component handles both new organization creation (deferred image upload) and existing organization editing (immediate authenticated uploads). It conditionally shows the logo uploader based on SaaS tenant mode and feature flags, with proper error handling and toast notifications for upload operations.
