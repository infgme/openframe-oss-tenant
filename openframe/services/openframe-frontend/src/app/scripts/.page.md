Main page component for the scripts management section of the OpenFrame platform. This client-side rendered page displays a table interface for managing automation scripts used by Flamingo's AI-powered MSP operations.

## Key Components

- **Scripts()** - Default exported React component that renders the scripts page
- **dynamic export** - Next.js configuration forcing dynamic rendering
- **AppLayout** - Wrapper component providing consistent application structure
- **ScriptsTable** - Main table component for displaying and managing scripts

## Usage Example

```typescript
// This page is automatically routed in Next.js App Router
// Access via: /scripts

import { Scripts } from './page'

// The component renders within the app's routing structure
export default Scripts
```

## Features

- **Client-side rendering** with `'use client'` directive for interactive functionality
- **Dynamic content** with `force-dynamic` export to ensure fresh data on each request
- **Responsive layout** using Flexbox with consistent spacing
- **Modular architecture** separating layout concerns from data display logic

The page serves as a container for the ScriptsTable component, which likely handles CRUD operations for automation scripts that power Mingo AI's technical assistance and Fae's client interaction capabilities within the OpenFrame platform.
