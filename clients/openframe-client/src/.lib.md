This file serves as the main library entry point for the Flamingo OpenFrame client agent, providing a unified Client struct that orchestrates all system components for MSP platform management.

## Key Components

- **ClientConfiguration** - Configuration structs for server connection, client settings, metrics, and security
- **Client** - Main orchestrating struct that manages all services and their dependencies
- **Module exports** - Exposes platform-specific adapters, services, clients, and system utilities
- **Service initialization** - Sets up HTTP clients, NATS messaging, authentication, and tool management
- **Directory management** - Handles file system operations with development mode support

## Usage Example

```rust
use openframe_client::Client;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Initialize the OpenFrame client
    let client = Client::new()?;
    
    // Start the client services
    client.start().await?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

The Client automatically detects development mode via the `OPENFRAME_DEV_MODE` environment variable and configures appropriate directory structures, TLS settings, and connection parameters for both production and development environments.
