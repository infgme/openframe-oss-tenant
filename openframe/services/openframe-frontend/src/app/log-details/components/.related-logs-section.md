<!-- source-hash: 81a9fa1d2f5f86e1fb9d5ab085877c40 -->
A React component that displays a chronological list of related security logs with visual connectors and source system icons.

## Key Components

- **RelatedLogsSection**: Main component that renders a card container with a list of related system logs
- **LogCard**: Individual log entry component with title, timestamp, and source icon
- **Icon Components**: Visual indicators for different MSP tools (FleetMDM, MeshCentral, TacticalRMM, and generic dot)
- **Visual Connectors**: Vertical lines that connect log entries to show chronological flow

## Features

- **Timeline View**: Logs are displayed in a vertical timeline format with connecting lines
- **Source Identification**: Each log entry shows an icon indicating the originating system (Fleet MDM, MeshCentral, Tactical RMM)
- **Responsive Design**: Uses Tailwind CSS classes with consistent spacing and typography
- **Mock Data**: Currently uses hardcoded sample data with a TODO for API integration

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { RelatedLogsSection } from './related-logs-section'

export function SecurityDashboard() {
  return (
    <div className="flex gap-4">
      <div className="flex-1">
        {/* Main content */}
      </div>
      <RelatedLogsSection />
    </div>
  )
}
```

The component automatically handles the visual connections between log entries and formats timestamps in the OpenFrame design system style.
