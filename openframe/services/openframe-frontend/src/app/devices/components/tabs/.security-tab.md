A React component that displays comprehensive security information for a device across multiple categories including encryption, MDM status, user sessions, security agents, and network configuration.

## Key Components

- **SecurityTab**: Main component that renders security information in organized sections
- **InfoCard**: Displays security data in structured card layouts
- **Tooltip Components**: Provides contextual help for security metrics
- **Security Sections**: Organized into Security Posture, User Sessions, Security Agents, Network Security, and Alert Configuration

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { SecurityTab } from './security-tab'

// Device object with security-related properties
const deviceData = {
  disk_encryption_enabled: true,
  mdm: {
    enrollment_status: 'enrolled',
    encryption_key_available: true,
    connected_to_fleet: true
  },
  logged_in_username: 'admin',
  users: [{ uid: 0 }, { uid: 1001 }],
  osquery_version: '5.8.2',
  primary_ip: '192.168.1.100',
  overdue_email_alert: true
}

function DeviceSecurityView() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SecurityTab device={deviceData} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

The component displays security information from Fleet MDM and Tactical RMM, including encryption status, MDM enrollment, active users, security agents (OpenFrame, osquery, Orbit), network interfaces, and alert configurations. Each section includes helpful tooltips explaining the security metrics and their importance for device management.
