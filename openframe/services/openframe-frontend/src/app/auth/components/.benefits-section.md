A React component that renders the authentication benefits section for the OpenFrame platform, displaying key value propositions and waitlist functionality for MSP users.

## Key Components

- **AuthBenefitsSection** - Main component with two rendering modes based on app configuration
- **Waitlist Form** - Email collection with validation and submission handling (saas-shared mode)
- **Benefits Display** - Three benefit cards highlighting platform advantages (standard mode)
- **Email Validation** - Built-in email format validation with user feedback
- **Community Integration** - Direct link to OpenMSP Slack community

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { AuthBenefitsSection } from './benefits-section'

function AuthPage() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen">
      <AuthBenefitsSection />
    </div>
  )
}

// Component automatically adapts based on runtime environment:
// - saas-shared: Shows waitlist signup form
// - other modes: Shows benefit cards with MSP value propositions
```

The component leverages the OpenFrame design system for consistent styling and integrates with the toast notification system for user feedback. It automatically handles different app modes and provides seamless community onboarding through the Slack integration.
