<!-- source-hash: 5c323afb71f2405355894e7f1192a340 -->
A React component that displays comprehensive device hardware information in a tabbed interface, organizing CPU, RAM, and disk data into visually structured cards.

## Key Components

- **HardwareTab**: Main component accepting a `Device` prop and rendering hardware sections
- **parseCpuModel()**: Processes CPU data arrays and extracts core counts and processor types
- **processDiskData()**: Complex function that groups disk partitions by physical drives and calculates usage statistics
- **InfoCard components**: Display hardware metrics with tooltips and progress bars for disk usage

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { HardwareTab } from './hardware-tab'
import { Device } from '../../types/device.types'

function DeviceDetails({ selectedDevice }: { selectedDevice: Device }) {
  return (
    <div className="device-tabs">
      <HardwareTab device={selectedDevice} />
    </div>
  )
}

// The component automatically handles:
// - Missing device data with fallback UI
// - Complex disk grouping (multiple partitions per physical disk)
// - CPU core count extraction from device metadata
// - Cross-platform disk naming (macOS disk0, Windows C:)
```

The component intelligently processes raw Fleet MDM data to present a clean hardware overview, with sophisticated disk analysis that groups partitions by physical drives and extracts meaningful storage metrics. Each hardware section includes contextual tooltips explaining the data source and purpose.
