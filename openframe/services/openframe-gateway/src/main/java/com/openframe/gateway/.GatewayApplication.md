Spring Boot application entry point for the OpenFrame Gateway service, providing the main bootstrap class that starts the gateway server and configures component scanning across OpenFrame modules.

## Key Components

- **GatewayApplication** - Main Spring Boot application class
- **@ComponentScan** - Configures scanning for components across multiple OpenFrame packages
- **main()** - Application entry point that starts the Spring Boot application

The class uses component scanning to automatically discover and register beans from the gateway, core, data, and security modules, enabling a modular architecture where the gateway can access shared functionality.

## Usage Example

```java
// Run the gateway application
public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(GatewayApplication.class, args);
}

// The component scan configuration allows injection of beans from other modules
@Autowired
private CoreService coreService; // From com.openframe.core

@Autowired  
private DataRepository dataRepository; // From com.openframe.data

@Autowired
private SecurityConfig securityConfig; // From com.openframe.security
```

The gateway serves as the entry point for the OpenFrame platform, orchestrating requests across the integrated MSP tool modules while leveraging shared core functionality, data access, and security features.
