A React component that provides a comprehensive device management interface with table and grid view modes, advanced filtering, search functionality, and cursor-based pagination.

## Key Components

- **DevicesView**: Main component combining table/grid views with filtering and pagination
- **useDevices**: Custom hook managing device data fetching and state
- **useCursorPaginationState**: Hook handling cursor-based pagination and search
- **useApiParams**: Hook managing URL parameters for filters and view mode
- **ViewToggle**: Component switching between table and grid display modes
- **Table/DevicesGrid**: Display components for different view modes

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { DevicesView } from './devices-view'

// Use as a page component
export default function DevicesPage() {
  return <DevicesView />
}

// The component automatically handles:
// - URL parameter synchronization for filters and view mode
// - Search functionality with debounced input
// - Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
// - Dynamic filtering by status, OS type, and organization
// - Navigation to device details on row/item click
```

The component supports both table and grid view modes, maintains filter and pagination state in URL parameters, and provides seamless navigation to device details. It integrates with the OpenFrame design system and includes organization image loading when the feature flag is enabled.
