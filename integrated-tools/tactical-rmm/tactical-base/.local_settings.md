Django local development configuration file that extends custom settings and configures database connections, security settings, and service integrations for the Tactical RMM application.

## Key Components

- **Database Configuration**: PostgreSQL connection settings with environment variable substitution
- **Security Settings**: Development-focused configurations with disabled CSRF/SSL protections
- **Service Integrations**: Redis caching, NATS messaging, and MeshCentral (disabled)
- **Debug Features**: Swagger API documentation and beta API endpoints enabled
- **Directory Paths**: Configurable paths for executables, logs, and community scripts

## Usage Example

```python
# This file is imported by Django's settings system
# Environment variables are substituted at runtime:

# Database connection uses these variables:
POSTGRES_DB = "tacticalrmm"
POSTGRES_USER = "tactical"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD = "your_password"
POSTGRES_HOST = "localhost" 
POSTGRES_PORT = "5432"

# Redis configuration
REDIS_HOST = "localhost"

# Application paths
TACTICAL_DIR = "/opt/tactical"
ADMINURL = "admin"

# Security toggles
TRMM_DISABLE_WEB_TERMINAL = False
TRMM_DISABLE_SERVER_SCRIPTS = False
TRMM_DISABLE_SSO = False
```

**Note**: This configuration is designed for local development with relaxed security settings. Production deployments should use more restrictive CORS, CSRF, and SSL configurations.
