A React component that displays an overview of organizations with device statistics, featuring individual organization cards alongside active and inactive device metrics in a responsive grid layout.

## Key Components

- **OrganizationsSkeleton**: Loading state component that renders placeholder cards for organizations and device statistics
- **OrganizationsOverviewSection**: Main component that fetches and displays organization data with navigation capabilities
- **useBatchImages**: Custom hook for optimized image loading when organization images are enabled
- **useOrganizationsOverview**: Hook that provides organization data, loading states, and error handling

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { OrganizationsOverviewSection } from './organizations-overview'

function DashboardPage() {
  return (
    <div className="p-6">
      <OrganizationsOverviewSection />
    </div>
  )
}

// The component automatically handles:
// - Loading states with skeleton placeholders
// - Error states with error messages
// - Navigation to filtered device views
// - Conditional image loading based on feature flags
// - Responsive grid layout for different screen sizes
```

The component renders a title with total organization count, followed by a responsive grid where each row contains an organization card, active devices card, and inactive devices card. Cards are clickable and navigate to filtered device views. The component includes comprehensive loading and error states, and conditionally loads organization images based on feature flag configuration.
