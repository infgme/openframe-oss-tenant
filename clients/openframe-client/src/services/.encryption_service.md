Service for encrypting sensitive data using AES-256-GCM encryption with base64 encoding. Currently uses a hardcoded key but is designed for future integration with proper key management.

## Key Components

- **EncryptionService** - Main service struct implementing AES-256-GCM encryption
- **encrypt()** - Encrypts plaintext data and returns base64-encoded result with embedded nonce
- **KEY** - Static encryption key (temporary implementation, marked for replacement)

## Technical Details

The service uses AES-256-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) which provides both confidentiality and authenticity. Each encryption operation:

1. Generates a random 12-byte nonce using OS random number generator
2. Encrypts the data with AES-256-GCM 
3. Combines nonce + ciphertext into single byte array
4. Base64 encodes the result for safe text transmission

The nonce is prepended to the ciphertext, eliminating the need for separate nonce storage and enabling proper decryption later.

## Usage Example

```rust
use anyhow::Result;

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let encryption_service = EncryptionService::new();
    
    // Encrypt sensitive data
    let plaintext = "sensitive user data";
    let encrypted = encryption_service.encrypt(plaintext)?;
    
    println!("Encrypted: {}", encrypted);
    // Output: Base64-encoded string containing nonce + encrypted data
    
    Ok(())
}
```

**Security Note**: The current implementation uses a hardcoded key for development purposes. Production deployments should replace this with proper key derivation or external key management systems.
