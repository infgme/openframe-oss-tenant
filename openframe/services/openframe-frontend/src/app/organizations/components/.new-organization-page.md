A React component that provides a comprehensive form interface for creating new organizations or editing existing ones through a tabbed navigation system.

## Key Components

- **NewOrganizationPage**: Main component handling organization creation/editing with tabbed interface
- **GeneralInformationTab**: Tab for basic organization details (name, category, employees, etc.)
- **ContactInformationTab**: Tab for contact information and addresses
- **State Management**: Local state for form data with prefilling for edit mode
- **API Integration**: Hooks for CRUD operations and image upload functionality

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Create new organization
<NewOrganizationPage organizationId={null} />

// Edit existing organization
<NewOrganizationPage organizationId="org-123" />

// Integration in routing
function OrganizationRouter({ params }: { params: { id?: string } }) {
  return (
    <NewOrganizationPage 
      organizationId={params.id || null} 
    />
  )
}
```

The component automatically switches between create and edit modes based on the `organizationId` prop, prefills form data when editing, handles form validation, manages image uploads, and provides user feedback through toast notifications. It uses a tabbed interface to organize complex organization data into logical sections for better user experience.
