<!-- source-hash: af388fd17d528f7bee02381f0263e7ce -->
A Next.js page component that serves as the client-side entry point for the user signup functionality, using dynamic imports to disable server-side rendering for the signup form.

## Key Components

- **Signup** - Default exported page component that renders the dynamically imported signup page
- **SignupPage** - Dynamically imported component from `@app/auth/pages/signup-page` with SSR disabled

## Usage Example

This page component is automatically routed by Next.js based on its file location:

```typescript
// Accessible at /signup route
// The component dynamically loads the signup page client-side only

export default function Signup() {
  return <SignupPage />
}
```

The dynamic import with `{ ssr: false }` ensures the signup form only renders on the client side, which is useful for forms that rely on browser-specific APIs or need to avoid hydration mismatches. This pattern is commonly used in authentication flows where client-side state management is preferred.
