Manages periodic machine heartbeat publishing to maintain system health monitoring and connectivity status reporting.

## Key Components

- **`MachineHeartbeatRunManager`** - Main struct that orchestrates heartbeat publishing
- **`new()`** - Constructor accepting a `MachineHeartbeatPublisher` dependency
- **`start()`** - Initiates the background heartbeat loop with 60-second intervals

## Usage Example

```rust
use crate::services::machine_heartbeat_publisher::MachineHeartbeatPublisher;

// Initialize the heartbeat publisher
let publisher = MachineHeartbeatPublisher::new(/* config */);

// Create and start the run manager
let manager = MachineHeartbeatRunManager::new(publisher);
manager.start();

// The manager will now send heartbeats every 60 seconds in the background
// Errors are logged but don't stop the heartbeat loop
```

The manager spawns an asynchronous task that continuously sends heartbeats at one-minute intervals. Failed heartbeat attempts are logged as errors but don't interrupt the periodic publishing cycle, ensuring robust system monitoring even during temporary connectivity issues.
