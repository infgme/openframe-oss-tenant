<!-- source-hash: 8f30e872f8c1c21d7afce19da01558d8 -->
A collection of GraphQL query constants for device management operations in the OpenFrame API, providing pre-defined queries for retrieving device information, filtering, and search functionality.

## Key Components

- **DEVICE_IDS** - Query to retrieve only machine IDs for devices matching a filter
- **DEVICE_HOSTNAMES** - Query to fetch hostnames of filtered devices
- **FULL_DEVICE** - Comprehensive query to get complete device details by machine ID
- **DEVICES_WITH_FILTER** - Query to retrieve filtered device list with basic information
- **SEARCH_DEVICE** - Query to search devices with filter and text search capabilities
- **DEVICE_FILTERS** - Query to retrieve available filter options and counts for the device management UI

## Usage Example

```java
// Use the query constants with GraphQL client
String queryString = DeviceQueries.FULL_DEVICE;
Map<String, Object> variables = Map.of("machineId", "device-123");

// Execute query to get complete device information
GraphQLResponse response = graphQLClient.execute(queryString, variables);

// Search for devices with hostname containing "server"
String searchQuery = DeviceQueries.SEARCH_DEVICE;
Map<String, Object> searchVars = Map.of(
    "search", "server",
    "filter", Map.of("status", "ONLINE")
);

GraphQLResponse searchResults = graphQLClient.execute(searchQuery, searchVars);
```

The queries support various filtering options including device status, type, OS type, organization, and tags, enabling flexible device management operations across the OpenFrame platform.
