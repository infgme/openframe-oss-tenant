This client-side React component initializes global configuration for image fetching hooks used throughout the OpenFrame frontend application.

## Key Components

- **`ImageConfigInitializer`**: Main component that configures image fetching hooks during app initialization
- **Configuration Setup**: Uses `configureBatchImageFetch` and `configureAuthenticatedImage` from the core hooks library
- **Runtime Environment Integration**: Pulls configuration values from the OpenFrame runtime environment

## Usage Example

```typescript
// App.tsx or root component
import { ImageConfigInitializer } from './components/image-config-initializer'

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <ImageConfigInitializer />
      {/* Rest of your app components */}
    </>
  )
}
```

The component must be rendered once at the application root level to ensure image hooks are properly configured before any components attempt to use them. It configures both batch image fetching and single authenticated image fetching with the tenant host URL, development mode settings, and access token storage key. The component returns `null` as it only performs configuration side effects without rendering any UI elements.
