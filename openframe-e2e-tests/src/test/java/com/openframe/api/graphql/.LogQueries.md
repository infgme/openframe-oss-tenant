A utility class containing GraphQL query constants for log management operations in the OpenFrame MSP platform. This class defines static query strings for retrieving log data, filters, and detailed log information.

## Key Components

- **LOG_FILTERS** - GraphQL query to retrieve available filter options including tool types, event types, severities, and organizations
- **LOGS** - Paginated GraphQL query to fetch log entries with filtering and search capabilities
- **LOG_DETAILS** - GraphQL query to retrieve detailed information for a specific log entry

## Usage Example

```java
import com.openframe.api.graphql.LogQueries;

// Execute log filters query
GraphQLRequest filterRequest = GraphQLRequest.builder()
    .query(LogQueries.LOG_FILTERS)
    .variables(Map.of("filter", filterInput))
    .build();

// Execute logs search with pagination
GraphQLRequest logsRequest = GraphQLRequest.builder()
    .query(LogQueries.LOGS)
    .variables(Map.of(
        "filter", logFilter,
        "search", searchTerm
    ))
    .build();

// Get specific log details
GraphQLRequest detailsRequest = GraphQLRequest.builder()
    .query(LogQueries.LOG_DETAILS)
    .variables(Map.of(
        "ingestDay", "2024-01-15",
        "toolType", "SECURITY",
        "eventType", "LOGIN_FAILURE",
        "timestamp", Instant.now(),
        "toolEventId", "log123"
    ))
    .build();
```

The queries support cursor-based pagination and include comprehensive log metadata such as organization details, severity levels, and device information for MSP monitoring workflows.
