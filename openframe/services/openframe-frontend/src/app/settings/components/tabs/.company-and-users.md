A React component that provides a unified interface for managing both users and invitations within an organization, displaying them in a single table with appropriate actions based on their type and status.

## Key Components

- **CompanyAndUsersTab** - Main component rendering a table of users and invitations with management actions
- **Status mapping objects** - `statusToLabel` and `statusToVariant` for consistent status display
- **Table configuration** - Column definitions for user data, roles, and status display
- **Modal handlers** - Functions for managing user deletion, invitation revocation, resending, and removal
- **Action menus** - Context-sensitive actions based on record type (user vs invitation) and status

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { CompanyAndUsersTab } from './company-and-users'

// Use within a settings or admin page
function OrganizationSettings() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CompanyAndUsersTab />
    </div>
  )
}

// The component handles its own state and provides:
// - Table display of users and pending invitations
// - Add users functionality via modal
// - Delete users (with role/ownership restrictions)
// - Revoke/resend/remove invitations based on status
// - Automatic status indicators and appropriate actions
```

The component integrates with the auth store to prevent self-deletion and owner account deletion, while providing different action sets for expired vs pending invitations. All mutations are handled with loading states and success callbacks for seamless user experience.
