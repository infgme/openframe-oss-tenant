A utility class that provides factory methods for creating pre-configured log filter objects to simplify common filtering operations in the OpenFrame platform.

## Key Components

- **severityAndToolFilter()** - Static factory method that creates a `LogFilterInput` with specific severity level and tool type filters

## Usage Example

```java
// Filter for error logs from monitoring tools
LogFilterInput errorFilter = LogGenerator.severityAndToolFilter("ERROR", "MONITORING");

// Filter for warning logs from backup tools  
LogFilterInput warningFilter = LogGenerator.severityAndToolFilter("WARNING", "BACKUP");

// Filter for info logs from network tools
LogFilterInput infoFilter = LogGenerator.severityAndToolFilter("INFO", "NETWORK");
```

This generator simplifies the creation of commonly used log filter combinations, reducing boilerplate code when filtering logs by both severity level and tool type. The method leverages the builder pattern from `LogFilterInput` to create properly configured filter objects that can be used throughout the OpenFrame logging system.
