Utility class that generates sample Script objects and response messages for testing and development purposes in the OpenFrame platform.

## Key Components

- **addScriptRequest()** - Static method that creates a sample PowerShell script for directory listing with predefined configuration
- **addScriptResponse()** - Generates success message for script addition operations
- **editScriptResponse()** - Generates success message for script editing operations

## Usage Example

```java
// Generate a sample script for testing
Script testScript = ScriptGenerator.addScriptRequest();

// Create response messages for operations
String addMessage = ScriptGenerator.addScriptResponse(testScript);
String editMessage = ScriptGenerator.editScriptResponse(testScript);

// Example output: "Dir was added!" or "Dir was edited!"
System.out.println(addMessage);
```

The generated script includes typical configuration such as PowerShell shell type, Windows platform support, custom category classification, argument handling, environment variables, and security settings. This class serves as a data factory for creating consistent test fixtures and example configurations throughout the OpenFrame MSP platform.
