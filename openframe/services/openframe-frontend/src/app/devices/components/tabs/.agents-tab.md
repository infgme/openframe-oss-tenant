A React component that displays management agents installed on a device, showing their versions, IDs, and connection status in a responsive card grid layout.

## Key Components

- **AgentsTab** - Main component that renders installed agents and tool connections
- **agentTypeToToolType** - Mapping object that converts agent types to standardized tool types
- **combinedAgents** - Merged data structure combining installed agents with their tool connections
- **InfoCard** - Card component displaying agent information with tooltips
- **ToolBadge** - Visual badge indicating the agent/tool type

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { AgentsTab } from './agents-tab'

// Example device with agents and connections
const device = {
  id: 'device-123',
  installedAgents: [
    { 
      agentType: 'tacticalrmm-agent', 
      version: '1.2.3' 
    }
  ],
  toolConnections: [
    { 
      toolType: 'TACTICAL_RMM', 
      agentToolId: 'agent-456' 
    }
  ]
}

function DeviceDetails({ device }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <AgentsTab device={device} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

The component intelligently combines installed agent data with tool connection information, displaying each agent as a card with its tool badge, version, and unique ID. When no agents are found, it shows an informational message with helpful context about agent functionality.
