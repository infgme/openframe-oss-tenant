Orchestrates the systematic uninstallation of tools by stopping processes, executing uninstall commands, and managing cleanup operations.

## Key Components

- **`ToolUninstallService`** - Main service for managing tool uninstallation workflows
- **`uninstall_all()`** - Uninstalls all registered tools sequentially with fail-fast behavior
- **`uninstall_tool()`** - Handles individual tool uninstallation including process termination
- **Dependencies** - Integrates with `InstalledToolsService`, `ToolKillService`, and `DirectoryManager`

## Usage Example

```rust
use anyhow::Result;

// Initialize the service with required dependencies
let uninstall_service = ToolUninstallService::new(
    installed_tools_service,
    command_params_resolver,
    tool_kill_service,
    directory_manager,
);

// Uninstall all tools (fails immediately on any error)
uninstall_service.uninstall_all().await?;
```

The service implements a fail-fast approach where any uninstallation failure stops the entire process. It handles special cases like Fleet tools that require stopping `osqueryd`, processes command parameter substitution, and validates executable paths before execution. The uninstallation workflow includes stopping tool processes, running custom uninstall commands, and leveraging automatic directory cleanup when the main application is removed.
